# SoundFlare

SoundFlare is an open-source observability and validation platform designed primarily for **Trillet AI** integration and **LiveKit** compatible Voice AI agents. It acts as a "flight recorder" for your voice assistants, providing real-time monitoring, automated evaluation, and deep analysis to ensure reliable and accurate voice experiences.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AI Validation Engine**: Automatically detects hallucinations, incorrect actions, and API failures in real-time.
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Track latency (TTFT), token costs, and success rates across your voice stack.
- **Automated Evaluations**: Stress-test your agents with AI-generated callers that mimic human behavior and edge cases.
- **Voice Bug Reporting**: Flag issues naturally using custom voice commands during live testing.
- **Deep Integration**: Purpose-built for [Trillet AI](https://trillet.ai) with native [LiveKit](https://livekit.io) compatibility.

## 🏁 Quick Start (Local Development)

We've designed the local setup to be as simple as possible using **Docker Compose**. This spins up a fully self-contained stack including the SoundFlare dashboard, a local Supabase backend (Auth, Database, API), and a gateway.

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Docker & Docker Compose** installed and running.

### 2. One-Command Setup
Simply run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrilletAI/Soundflare.git
cd Soundflare
./scripts/docker-start.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
1. Auto-generate `.env.docker` with unique JWT keys (if not exists)
2. Display your credentials in the terminal
3. Save credentials to `.docker-credentials.txt` for later reference
4. Start all Docker services

**Your credentials are shown on first run and saved to `.docker-credentials.txt`**

- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Supabase API**: `http://localhost:54321`

### 🔐 Access Credentials

**Default Dashboard Login:**
- **Email**: `admin@soundflare.ai`
- **Password**: `password123`

**Your API Keys:**
Check `.docker-credentials.txt` in the project root for your unique Supabase keys (anon key & service role key). These are auto-generated on first run.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Environment

SoundFlare uses **two separate environment files** to avoid confusion between local Docker development and production deployments. We recommend using Docker for local testing to get going quickly, and a dedicated `.env` for production/Vercel hosting.

### Environment Files Explained

#### 1. `.env.docker` - Local Docker Development
- **Purpose**: Used exclusively by `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- **Auto-generated**: Created by `./scripts/docker-start.sh`
- **Contains**: Local Supabase URLs and JWT tokens signed with your custom secret
- **Why separate?**: Ensures everyone's local Docker environment has properly matched JWT keys
- **Git**: Ignored by `.gitignore` (never commit this file)

**Example `.env.docker`:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
SUPABASE_INTERNAL_URL=http://kong:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc... # Auto-generated
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc... # Auto-generated
JWT_SECRET=your-custom-jwt-secret
```

#### 2. `.env` - Production / Vercel Hosting
- **Purpose**: Used for production deployments (Vercel, Cloud, etc.) and your own Supabase instance
- **Manual setup**: You configure this for your managed/self-hosted Supabase
- **Contains**: Remote Supabase URLs, API keys, and production secrets
- **Why separate?**: Prevents mixing local Docker configs with production credentials
- **Git**: Ignored by `.gitignore` (never commit this file)

**To create `.env`:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit with your production Supabase credentials
```

**Required for Production:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your managed Supabase URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your managed Supabase Anon Key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your managed Supabase Service Role Key

**Optional for AI Features:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For AI-powered transcript analysis and call reviews

### Important Notes

- **Docker Compose** reads **only** `.env.docker` (auto-generated by `./scripts/docker-start.sh`)
- **Vercel / Next.js** reads `.env` for production deployments
- Your unique JWT keys are saved in `.docker-credentials.txt` for easy reference
- All credential files are git-ignored to protect your secrets
- To regenerate keys: delete `.env.docker` and run `./scripts/docker-start.sh` again

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Login Issues or "Invalid Credentials"
If you cannot log in with the default credentials, or if the database container had issues starting:

1. **Reset the Environment**:
   ```bash
   docker compose down -v
   ./scripts/docker-start.sh
   ```

2. **Check Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f web
   docker compose logs -f auth
   docker compose logs -f kong
   ```

3. **View Your Credentials**:
   ```bash
   cat .docker-credentials.txt
   ```

### CORS Errors
If you see network errors in the browser console, ensure you are accessing the dashboard at `http://localhost:8000` exactly. The local gateway is configured to allow requests from this origin.

## 🔌 Integrating Your Agent

Connect your Python-based LiveKit/Trillet agent using the SoundFlare SDK.

### 1. Install the SDK
> **Coming Soon**: The `soundflare` pip package is being prepared for release.

```bash
pip install soundflare
```

### 2. Add Observability
```python
import os
from soundflare import LivekitObserve
from livekit.agents import AgentSession

# Initialize
soundflare = LivekitObserve(
    agent_id="YOUR_AGENT_ID",
    apikey="YOUR_API_KEY" # Generate this in the SoundFlare Dashboard
)

async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    session = AgentSession(...)
    
    # Start monitoring
    session_id = soundflare.start_session(session=session)
    
    # Export data on shutdown
    async def on_shutdown():
        await soundflare.export(session_id)
    ctx.add_shutdown_callback(on_shutdown)
    
    await session.start(...)
```
